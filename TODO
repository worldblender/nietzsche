TODO:
- "you" should be a different color than the other players
- maybe check out sencha touch "pop" animation for when bombs explode and damage you
- run through jslint
- when in attack mode, be able to just click on a player
- make it easier to fire -- info on initial target click
- compress javascript before production http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/
- modify the allPlayers and allMissiles data type so non-needed fields are not sent to the client
- handle death
- need iphone icon and screen
- phonegap wrapper
- why don't some phones show the players/missiles? (Mike's sometimes)
- better reconnection screen (stay on until reconnected)
- on android, the markers don't render, the app seems frozeny (found open bug, which should be fixed in sencha touch 1.0.1 http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?111727-OPEN-403-Android-2.2-map-bug/page2)
