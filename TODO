TODO:
- "you" should be a different color than the other players
- maybe check out sencha touch "pop" animation for when bombs explode and damage you
- run through jslint
- when in attack mode, players should not be clickable
- make it easier to fire -- info on initial target click
- compress javascript before production http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/
- handle respawning
- need iphone icon and screen
- phonegap wrapper
- on android, the markers don't render, the app seems frozeny (found open bug, which should be fixed in sencha touch 1.0.1 http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?111727-OPEN-403-Android-2.2-map-bug/page2)
